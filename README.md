# RANSONWARE

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that infects a computer and restricts users' access to it until a
ransom is paid to unlock it.(Berkeley Security)

### Criptography

The two most importants types of cryptography are:

    symmetric encryption: all parts use the same key and its most fast

    asymmetric encryption: senders and receives uses diferent keys, senders uses public
    keys and receives uses private key


### RSA

RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm that uses modular mathematics and
properties of prime numbers to encrypt and decrypt data. The algorithm was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir
and Leonard Adleman, and is widely used to ensure security in digital communications such as banking, e-commerce,
emails and instant messaging.
